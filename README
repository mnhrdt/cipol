Architecture for cipol
----------------------

Cipol is a tool for remote code execution in image procesing.  Its goal
is to verify the reproducibility of IPOL articles without the need
download and compile any code.

The server installation has the following ingredients:

NOT INCLUDED:
	* mini_httpd: a web server with cgi support
	* sshd: needed for creating a local chroot jail
	* gcc: or any C compiler for compiling the code locally

INCLUDED:
	* iio: for reading and writing images
	* nurse: to run the user-supplied programs in a controlled environment
	* index.html, cgi-bin/run{,c}, run_single.sh: webpage and cgi files

System configuration options:

$CIPOL_ROOT : contains index.html and cgi-bin/run.cgi
$CIPOL_LOCAL_SCRATCH
$CIPOL_LOCK_FILE (not needed, actually depends on the local scratch)
$CIPOL_JAIL_ROOT (e.g. "/home/jail")
$CIPOL_JAIL_USER (e.g. "bush")
$CIPOL_JAIL_ID (e.g. $CIPOL_ROOT/id_rsa.bush.priv)

$CIPOL_CC="c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic-errors -static -O3 -fopenmp"
$CIPOL_CC_LIBS="iio.o -lm -lpng -ltiff -ljpeg ..."


How to install:

1. verify that you have all the requirements (mini_httpd, sshd and a compiler)
2.
